 * Condense a server error for display in a toast.

 * Some backend errors are enormous and mostly noise. The transformers
 * "Unrecognized model" error is ~4.8KB, of which the first sentence carries all
 * the meaning and the remaining 4.7KB is an alphabetical list of every model
 * architecture it knows about. Rendering that in a 420px toast clipped the text
 * at both ends and pushed the close button off-screen.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately generic rather than pattern-matching any one
 * library: keep the head, cut at the most natural boundary available inside the
 * budget, and report how much was dropped so nobody assumes they read it all.

 *
 * Roughly the first paragraph — enough for a sentence or two of real message.
 * This bounds the *message* rather than the rendered string: `display` is this
 * plus `TRUNCATION_SUFFIX` when something was cut. Spending two of these
 * characters on the ellipsis instead would shorten the message to no purpose,
 * since nothing downstream has a hard character limit — the description box
 * scrolls.
