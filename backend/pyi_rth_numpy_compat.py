"""
PyInstaller runtime hook: numpy 2.x / torch ABI mismatch fix.

Problem
-------
torch is compiled against numpy 1.x headers. numpy 2.x changed the version
number returned by PyArray_GetNDArrayCVersion() (0x01000009 → 0x02000000),
so torch's is_numpy_available() returns False and every torch.from_numpy()
call raises:

    RuntimeError: Numpy is not available

This surfaces as:

    ValueError: Unable to create tensor, you should probably activate
    padding with 'padding=True'

during TTS generation (EncodecFeatureExtractor → BatchFeature.convert_to_tensors).

Fix
---
Runtime hooks execute after PyInstaller's FrozenImporter is registered, so
frozen torch/numpy are importable here. We start a background thread that
waits for torch to finish loading then wraps torch.from_numpy with a ctypes
memmove fallback that bypasses the C-level numpy ABI check entirely.

This approach works with any numpy version and is safer than binary-patching
libtorch_python.dylib (which risks PyArray_Descr struct layout mismatches).
