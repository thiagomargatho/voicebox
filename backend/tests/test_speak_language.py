"""Tests for voice-profile language fallback on the two speak surfaces.

Both speak paths built their ``GenerationRequest`` with a hardcoded ``"en"``
fallback and never consulted the resolved profile, so a profile created with
``language="fr"`` was still synthesised as English unless every caller passed
``language=`` explicitly. Agents going through MCP had no way to know the
profile's language, so they couldn't pass it either.

These tests pin the fix: the fallback chain is now explicit argument →
resolved profile's language → ``"en"``, matching how ``engine`` and
``personality`` already consult the resolved binding.
