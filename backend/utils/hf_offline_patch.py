# huggingface_hub reads ``HF_HUB_OFFLINE`` once at import time into
# ``huggingface_hub.constants.HF_HUB_OFFLINE``; transformers mirrors that into
# ``transformers.utils.hub._is_offline_mode`` at *its* import time. Toggling
# ``os.environ`` after either module is imported does not flip those cached
# bools, and the hot paths (``_http._default_backend_factory``,
# ``transformers.utils.hub.is_offline_mode``) read the bools — not the env.
# We mutate the cached constants directly, guarded by a refcount so
# concurrent inference threads share a single offline window safely.
#
# That refcounted window is process-global, so an *uncached* load (which
# needs real network access) must never run while it's open — it would
# silently inherit HF_HUB_OFFLINE=True from an unrelated concurrent cached
# load and fail to fetch what it needs. Symmetrically, a new offline window
# must not open while an uncached load is in flight. Both directions wait on
# a condition variable rather than a plain lock: holding a lock for an
# entire model load (which can take minutes over the network) would also
# serialize unrelated *cached* loads against each other, which sharing the
# window is specifically meant to allow.
